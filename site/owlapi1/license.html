<p>The Apache Software Foundation uses various licenses to <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#distributions">distribute
software and documentation</a>, to accept regular
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">contributions from individuals and corporations</a>, and to accept
larger <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#grants">grants of existing software products</a>.</p>
<p>These licenses help us achieve our goal of providing reliable and
long-lived software products through collaborative open source software
development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their
original contributions for any other purpose outside of Apache while
providing the ASF and its projects the right to distribute and build upon
their work within Apache.</p>
<h1 id="distributions">Licensing of Distributions<a class="headerlink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#distributions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>All software produced by The Apache Software Foundation or any of its
projects or subjects is licensed according to the terms of the documents
listed below.</p>
<h3 id="2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0 (current)<a class="headerlink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#2.0" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a> (

<p>The 2.0 version of the Apache License was approved by the ASF in 2004. The
goals of this license revision have been to reduce the number of frequently
asked questions, to allow the license to be reusable without modification
by any project (including non-ASF projects), to allow the license to be
included by reference instead of listed in every file, to clarify the
license on submission of contributions, to require a patent license on
contributions that necessarily infringe the contributor's own patents, and
to move comments regarding Apache and other inherited attribution notices
to a location outside the license terms (the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/example-NOTICE.txt">NOTICE
file</a> ).</p>
<p>The result is a license that is supposed to be compatible with other open
source licenses, while remaining true to the original goals of the Apache
Group and supportive of collaborative development across both nonprofit and
commercial organizations. The Apache Software Foundation is still trying to
determine if this version of the Apache License is <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html">compatible with the
GPL</a>.</p>
<p>All packages produced by the ASF are implicitly licensed under the Apache
License, Version 2.0, unless otherwise explicitly stated. More developer
documentation on how to apply the Apache License to your work can be found

<p><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.1">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.1</a> </p>
<p>The 1.1 version of the Apache License was approved by the ASF in 2000. The
primary change from the 1.0 license is in the 'advertising clause' (section
3 of the 1.0 license); derived products are no longer required to include
attribution in their advertising materials, only in their documentation.</p>
<p>Individual packages licensed under the 1.1 version may have used different
wording due to varying requirements for attribution or mark identification,
but the binding terms were all the same.</p>
<h3 id="1.0">Apache License, Version 1.0 (historic)<a class="headerlink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#1.0" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.0">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.0</a> </p>
<p>This is the original Apache License which applies only to older versions of
Apache packages (such as version 1.2 of the Web server).</p>
<h1 id="clas">Contributor License Agreements<a class="headerlink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The ASF desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to
any Apache projects complete, sign, and submit (via fax or
email) an <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf">Individual Contributor License Agreement</a> (ICLA). 
The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the
terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the ASF and
thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute
regarding the software at some future time. A signed ICLA is required to be
on file before an individual is given commit rights to any ASF project.</p>
<p>For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on an Apache project,
a <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt">Corporate CLA</a> (CCLA) is available for contributing
intellectual property via the corporation, that may have been assigned as
part of an employment agreement. Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove
the need for every developer to sign their own ICLA as an individual, which
covers both contributions which are owned and those that are not owned by the corporation
signing the CCLA.</p>
<p>The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so it must be signed by a person with
authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation.</p>
<p>The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to
use one's personal email address in the contact details, rather than an @work
address.</p>
<p>Your Full name will be published unless you provide an alternative Public name.
For example if your full name is Andrew Bernard Charles Dickens, but you wish
to be known as Andrew Dickens, please enter the latter as your Public name.</p>
<p>The email address and other contact details are not published.</p>
<h1 id="grants">Software Grants<a class="headerlink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#grants" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>When an individual or corporation decides to donate a body of existing
software or documentation to one of the Apache projects, they need to
execute a formal <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/software-grant-template.pdf">Software Grant Agreement</a> (SGA) with
the ASF. Typically, this is done after negotiating approval with the ASF
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Incubator</a> or one of the PMCs, since the ASF
will not accept software unless there is a viable community available to
support a collaborative project.</p>
<h1 id="submitting">Submitting License Agreements and Grants<a class="headerlink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#submitting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Documents may be submitted by fax or email.</p>
<p>If submitting by fax, please print, sign, and fax all pages of the document 
to +1-919-573-9199. Please send documents right-side-up, first page first;
and send only one document per fax.</p>
<p>If submitting by email, please fill the form with a pdf viewer,
print, sign, scan all pages into a single pdf file, 
and email the pdf file as an attachment to secretary@apache.org. If possible,
send the attachment from the email address in the document.
Please send only one document per email.</p>
<p>If you prefer to sign electronically, please fill the form, save it locally (e.g. icla.pdf), and sign the
file by preparing a detached PGP signature. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gpg --armor --detach-sign icla.pdf</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above will create a file icla.pdf.asc. Send both the file (icla.pdf) and signature
(icla.pdf.asc) as attachments in the same email to secretary@apache.org. Please send only one 
document (file plus signature) per email. Please do not submit your public key to Apache.
Instead, please upload your public key to pgpkeys.mit.edu. </p>
<p>The files should be named
icla.pdf and icla.pdf.asc for individual agreements;
ccla.pdf and ccla.pdf.asc  for corporate agreements;
software-grant.pdf and software-grant.pdf.asc for grants. </p>
<p>Please note that typing your name in the field at the bottom of the document is not signing.
Signing is either writing your signature by hand on a printed copy of the document,
or digitally signing via gpg. </p>
<p>From wikipedia.com: A signature is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name
or nickname, on documents as a proof of identity and intent. </p>

<pre>                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
