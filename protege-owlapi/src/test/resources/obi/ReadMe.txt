This is simply a copy of the obi ontology for testing purposes only.  The
development version can be found 

   https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology

and the Protege group is not involved in this work.  These files will
probably be replaced at some point with some smaller files that focus on the
features of this obi ontology that we want to test.
